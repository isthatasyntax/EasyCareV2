# EasyCareV2
Welcome to Easy Care, your trusted companion in the world of caregiving. We understand the challenges that caregivers face in managing appointments and patient information efficiently. Thatâ€™s why we have developed an intuitive website and app to simplify your caregiving journey

This is what our website does:
Appointment management: Say goodbye to scheduling conflicts and missed appointments. Our platform allows caregivers to effortlessly manage appointments and maintain a clear overview of their schedule.
Patient information: Keeping track of patient information has never been easier. With Easy Care, caregivers can securely store and access patient records, medical history and vital details ensuring continuity of care and personalised support.

This is all the files for the website EasyCare which is a project for me and my team's collaborative development project.
